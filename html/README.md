# Whiteboard
This project is an agile development website to track changes in a project as it progresses through its lifecycle.  I've added this project because a youtube video suggested it would be a good idea.  I will be using Bootstrap, JQuery, and PHP because I need to get this done quickly and don't have the luxury of learning new technologies since I will be using those in my other projects.

How it works: It will be following the scrum agile development method of development and it is my hope that I can use the application as I develop it.  You will be able to log in or create an account.  You can add or edit exists projects.  You can add and edit tasks that will be put to the backlog for those projects.  You can add milestone for projects.  You can add comments to tasks about their progress once they are assigned to a sprint.  You can change the status of items in a sprint. Progress on the sprints can be monitored and you can check on the progress of others in your project during a sprint.  I initially thought about adding links to the commits for those tasks as a part of completion, but decided against it for now, as there may be some unintended side effects.
